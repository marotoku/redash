# redash
**_Redash_** is our take on freeing the data within our company in a way that will better fit our culture and usage patterns.

Prior to **_Redash_**, we tried to use traditional BI suites and discovered a set of bloated, technically challenged and slow tools/flows. What we were looking for was a more hacker'ish way to look at data, so we built one.

**_Redash_** was built to allow fast and easy access to billions of records, that we process and collect using Amazon Redshift ("petabyte scale data warehouse" that "speaks" PostgreSQL).
Today **_Redash_** has support for querying multiple databases, including: Redshift, Google BigQuery, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Graphite,
Presto, Google Spreadsheets, Cloudera Impala, Hive and custom scripts.

The **_Redash_** is owned by [getredash](https://github.com/getredash/redash) The as I am an ansible lover and I did not find anything in the ansible-galaxy I decided to create this role for you that use ansible.
